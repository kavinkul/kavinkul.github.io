                    <li>The top display shows non-hereditary base-N number while the bottom display shows the base-N of this number.</li>
                    <li>To solve this module, convert the number from the top display into a hereditary base-K number. The base of this number will not be given on the module.</li>

	  <p>Once the hereditary base-K number is calculated, take all the digits (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J are considered as a single digit) in the number and do the following:</p>
	      <ul>
	          <li>If non-hereditary and hereditary bases are both odd or even, add all digits together to get the final number.</li>
	          <li>Otherwise, multiply all digits together to get the final number. Modulo it with 10,000 if it exceeds 9,999.</li>
	          <li>Ignore any digit 0 as it will not be used in any of the calculation.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>The final number must be submitted in non-hereditary base-L number where L is the difference between the number of false statements and the displayed base with negative sign dropped. If the number L is less than 2, then submit the final number in base 10. If the number L is greater than 16, then submit the final number in base 8.</p>
	      <p>Submitting the correct number will solve the module while submitting an incorrect number will incur a strike.</p>
                  
                    <h3>Appendix H: Hereditary Base N notation</h3>
	      <p>Normally, any non-hereditary base M number can be written in the following way. If the number that we want to convert is X, then:</p>
	      <div align = "center">
	      <img src="img/Component/Base M Equation.svg" width = "60%">
	      </div>
                    <p>For example, 47 in base 3 is</p>	      
	      <div align = "center">
	      <img src="img/Component/Example Equation 1.svg" width = "30%">
	      </div>
	      <p>A hereditary base N notation imposes an additional requirement that every number, except the base of an exponent, must be less than the base itself. This means that each of the exponent must be converted into base N number. If, after conversion, the exponent of an exponent is still greater than or equal to the base N, this exponent must also be converted to a base-N number. Repeat this process until every digit that is not the base is less than the base itself.</p>
	      <p>For the purpose of zero ambiguity, 1 that are coefficients of the base to the power s and 1 that are the exponents of the base must be written explicitly. The term that contains base to the power of 0 will only have its coefficient written. For example, 3201 in hereditary base 4 is</p>
